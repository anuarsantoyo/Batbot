The CMA algorithm used in this project is initialized and used as follow.
A so-called solution proposed by the CMA algorithm consists of a five-dimensional vector
whose elements can only have values between 0 and 1.
This was done in order to simplify the coding process.
The values from 0 and 1 are there then later on converted to the actual needed values
or the values that actually represent movements and specific angles of the servo motors or the flapping speed.
The five dimensions will be now explained.
Thanks to the research of Dr. Sudip that obtained data from BAT,
we know that the movement of the hind legs of the bat is of crucial importance when controlling the flight of the bat.
And we can also see that the movement of the hind legs follows something very similar to an ellipse.
So, in these thesis, the solution, this five-dimensional vector, is understood as the parametrization of the movement of the hind legs in an elliptical shape.
So, one dimension describes the width of the ellipse.
The other dimension describes the height of the ellipse.
Another dimension describes the middle point of the ellipse on the horizontal axis.
Another dimension describes the middle point of the ellipse on the vertical axis.
And the last dimension describes the orientation of the ellipse.
As we can have, for example, a thin ellipse, which is very long,
but it's rotated or inclinated 35 degrees with respect to the horizontal axis.
So, using these five parameters, we can describe every single possible movement in an elliptical form of the hind leg.
It must also be mentioned that with the inclination parameter, also the direction of the rotation can be controlled.
With this knowledge, the CMA algorithm can be initialized, setting the covariance matrix at the middle point of 0.5 in every dimension with a sigma of 0.5 for their normal distributions.
