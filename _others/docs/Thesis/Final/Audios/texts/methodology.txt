In this chapter I will be talking about the methodology used in these master
thesis. I will explain a little bit about the test benches that I used, the
static and the dynamic one, how they're built, their usage and I am also going to
make a very deep explanation of the optimization algorithm that I developed
and implemented in these pieces. The exact description of the bad bot, its
components, the mechanical design and so forth, changed it throughout the master
thesis. Several experiments gave light to different discoveries which allowed us
to improve the design of the bad bot. For this reason the bad bot
information won't be included in the methodology chapter as in the coming
chapters for each version there will be a detailed explanation.
