On the second version of the static test bench all the metallic structures were
removed and the load sensors were replaced by a sensor called decent that
is a six-actual force and torque sensor. This simplified structure has a lot of
advantages. First of all the bad boat is directly connected to the sensor meaning
that there are no metallic structures or components connecting the bad boat to
the sensor which eliminates the problematic of moving parts or stress
being inputted into the whole structure. Another great advantage of the second
version of the static test bench is the fact that we are being able to very
clearly measure not only the forces exerted by the bad box but also the
moment also known as torque. These sensors are specialized sensors which
don't have the same mission as the first version in which the torque and the
thrust multiplied with the distance to the loads would contaminate the data
from each other in the load sensors.
