Now, I would like to talk about the dynamic test bench.
The idea and goal of the dynamic test bench is to provide the bat bot an environment that
replicates the real case scenario in which the bat bot would be trying to achieve hovering
as close as possible to reality whilst protecting the bat bot from the ground or falling.
The dynamic test bench consists on the following.
First we used the six axis force and torque sensor and we attached it to the ceiling.
From this an elastic string with the elastic modulus of 0.6 is attached and the length
of 0.6 at the end of the string the bat bot is hanged from the nose, positioning the bat
bot in a vertical position which is the one needed in order to achieve hovering.
Given the force measurements of the sensor we can calculate first the direction in which
the bat bot is at the moment.
This could be achieved by normalizing the force vector measurement and we can also achieve
the resulting force that the bat bot is accepting on the sensor.
This can be calculated by calculating the Euclidean distance of the three dimensional
force vector that the sensor reads.
With the direction information and the total force information we can use Hooke's Laws
that also includes the length of the elastic and its elastic modulus and we can use this
in order to correctly calculate the position of the bat.
That way using the dynamic test bench we can not only calculate the force that is being
pulled on the sensor which means how much is the elastic string actually pulling on
the bat bot and how much is the action of the flapping exerting an upward force on the
bat bot but we can also calculate the position of the bat bot the whole time.
All of this while keeping the bat safe ensuring the possibility of repetitive experimentation.
