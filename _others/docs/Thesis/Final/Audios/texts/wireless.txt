In order to recreate the real environment of the bat flying as close as possible,
wireless communication between the computer and the bat bot must be achieved.
I use different modules and strategies to try to achieve this.
I use the Wi-Fi module ESP8266 and try to connect the computer using a common Wi-Fi router
to which the bat bot was also connected.
I try to pass the information of the proposed solutions using GET requests.
This proved to be very impractical as the ESP8266 was not reliable and would sometimes connect and disconnect.
The second attempt I did was using the Bluetooth module HC05.
This also proved to be very impractical as the Bluetooth module would also connect and disconnect constantly
and would also suffer sometimes from interference.
Finally, the last module tested which proved to be the best one and the most efficient was a wireless UART module.
This was very easy to install in the bat bot, was lightweighted, was very reliable.
It's just a matter of connecting an emitter to the computer where the Python code was rolling.
The Python code using a serial communication package and a bot rate from 115200
could very practically and efficiently and quickly send the proposed solution to the bat bot
which had a receiver connected to its microprocessor that obtained the proposed solution of the CMA algorithm
which then let it run the proposed solution in the program of the microcontroller of the bat bot.
The wireless UART proved to be the best solution.
