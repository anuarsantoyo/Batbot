The first version of the bat bot was given to me as Dr. Lee had created it.
It used one crane and it had two long legs. Each leg was controlled only by one servomotor,
which meant that we could only control the angle in the vertical direction.
Also, there was a membrane connecting both of the legs, as well as no folding and unfolding functionality.
The controlling system was very simple as it only was controlled using a radio control
and a receiver that directly controlled the flapping frequency and both of the legs.
This had the advantage of making the bat bot electronic materials very light.
We conducted several experiments in which we were able to obtain a stable flight in the forward direction.
This was very promising but had the issue that without being able to create rotational movements of the legs
controlling and hovering would be very complicated.
Nevertheless, we could prove that forward flight with this mechanical design could be achieved
and that the membrane wings, when flapped around 4 Hz, generated enough lift to sustain the bat bot in the air.
