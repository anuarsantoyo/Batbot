Using the result of the experiments of the Bad Bot version 3, now the Bad Bot version 4 was developed.
The main mechanical difference with regard to the Bad Bot version 3 and Bad Bot version 4 are as follows.
First of all, the legs were now constructed to the scale of the real fruit bat,
which meant that the legs were now much longer, which will provide the ability of producing more torque
by quick and rapid movements of the legs, which will then allow the Bad Bot to do rotations in the air.
On the electronic part, which is also in this case will be influencing the mechanical part,
we incorporated an embedded system that helped us eliminate the need of the PCA module
and combined a lot of the components within only the embedded system.
This was very useful as it first of all reduced drastically the weight of the Bad Bot by 75 grams
and also made the structures much easier to handle as less wires were needed.
