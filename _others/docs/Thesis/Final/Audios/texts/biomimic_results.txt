So in this next section I am going to analyze and explain a little bit the results and the
comparison of the results within the different tests.
So we start with the experiment one, the Synchronous Bat Mimic Motion.
It has a good value, we can clearly see as well that the thrust is much higher than the
lift generated.
We have a thrust value of 0.88 and a lift value of 0.38, so it's clearly thrust is
playing a larger role on the force generation and we have a force of 0,96.
This value can be used as a reference point when comparing the rest of the experiments.
So we can go to experiment number two where the legs are stretched.
This is very interesting because we can see here that the hind leg motion is definitely
very important.
We not only have a lower thrust value but also a lower lift value and of course because
of consequence we have as well a lower force at the end of 0.89.
This shows that the motion of the legs are definitely important when generating lift
and thrust.
Even though by stretch legs the membrane was the most stretched the whole time and one
could not believe or assume that that would generate more force.
We can very clearly see here that that is not the case.
If we now compare the third experiments using the leg stretch and also no folding and unfolding
in order to see the influence that folding has, we can see that the values are actually
very similar to the ones of the experiment two.
Of course as we expected the thrust is lower and the lift is lower as well and the general
force is as well lower but it is not so different from our results in experiment one than our
results on experiment two.
So the results of the experiment three are much similar to the results of experiment
two than the ones to experiment one which is very interesting because we would have
assumed that the folding and unfolding mechanism was also very important with regard of generating
lift and force and what we can see here is that even though it definitely has an influence
it is not as big as the hind leg movement of the bad butt.
So we can analyze the results of the experiment number four now.
On the experiment number four we can see that the results regarding lift were a little bit
various but constantly the increasing of the X amplitude showed to provide higher thrust
to the bad butt when compared to our reference point of experiment number one.
An interesting thing to see as well is that with increasing angles also our resulting
force increases being the largest force of one Newton achieved by when the angle of the
amplitude of the X lateral motion was equal to 90 degrees the maximum tested but even
though there is a clear sign that with higher angles we are achieving higher forces what
is also interesting to see is that the difference in the forces within these experiments don't
change as much.
We can conclude that the simple action of opening and closing the legs are already of
great advantage especially when we compare these results to the low values achieved in
experiment two when the legs were just stretched.
We come now to the results of experiment number five.
Experiments number five which were the changing delay in ten different points ranging from
zero to two pi at a constant distance from each other.
We can see that the resulting forces had the largest variance of all the results that we
have within this set of experiments we had the worst experiments possible with very low
lift and very low thrust values but also we can see the best performing results with
very high thrust much higher than with the experiments from experiments number four.
This clearly states that the delay or the phase shift between the flapping of the hind legs
and the wing flapping plays a very important role in force generation.
Another very interesting thing that we can see in the results of the experiment number
five is that when the phase shift lies between zero and pi which as explained before means
that the hind leg flapping is delayed to the wing flapping we see our worst results constantly.
All of the results that are between zero and pi have worst performances than our reference
experiment and all of the experiments that were taken with a value between p and two
pi which can be understood as the hind legs flapping moving ahead with respect to the
wing beats cycle show to have better performances than their other five counterparting experiments
and within these experiments we can find the largest forces and the best performing experiments.
In this case contrary to what we saw in experiment number four there is a spot where the value
increases of the force that we can see by experiment number eight but when we achieve
experiment number nine the value of the force starts decreasing as well so there is not
a direct relationship between a higher delay and a higher force something that we can see
with the angles of experiment number four. In order to gain a better understanding of
the results we were seeing in the experiments that were done we thought to create a correlation
matrix in order to try to see if there are some results that stronger correlate with
the force that we're trying to maximize and we found very interesting.
insights first of all we can clearly see that the thrust has a 0.97 correlation with the force
which makes sense because as explained before most of the force is thrust in our experiments
and lift has a very slow correlation of course these are not as relevant as other data because
it is clear and obvious then thrust and lift are related to force as force is simply
the Euclidean distance between the thrust and the lift. As we can see the angle has a
minus 0.49 correlation which doesn't
show of much interest. Nevertheless we could see a very high correlation of 0.82 in frequency
which was a very interesting as it was not expected and this could give insight to better
understanding why the results behave the way they did. So for this reason we decided to
do a deeper analysis in the frequency
of the experiments with respect to the force they generated.
Once we plot the frequency value against the force value we could very clearly see
that there is a very clear collinearity. This is very interesting because
as mentioned at the beginning of this section all the experiments were done using
the same voltage 11.6 and the same DC motor command. This means that the power that was
being applied to the DC motor for the flapping was in every single scenario the exact same.
So where does the frequency value difference come from and it comes from the fact that the legs
are moving and depending on the angle of the leg there is either more resistance against the wind
or less resistance. So what we can see is the result is that apparently at the experiments
that were being done the most important aspect in order to generate high forces is not necessarily
a specific movement that generates forces but a movement that reduces the wind resistivity of
the wing which allows the bat to achieve higher frequencies with the same input power. This is
very interesting because with this we can show that one of the most important roles of the
hind leg movement is also the reduction of the area of the wing in order to reduce
the wind resistance. At the experiments done we can see that this high correlation points to the fact that
the primary aspect in order to achieve higher forces is to be able to achieve higher frequencies.
