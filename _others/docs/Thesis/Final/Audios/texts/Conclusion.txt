In conclusion, in these thesis we were able to develop a optimization algorithm strategy
using several test bench and the CMA algorithm in order to try to find an optimal solution
for the hovering of a bad bot.
The results definitely proved to be promising throughout the way the optimization algorithms
brought to the light deficiencies that the bad bot had that were step by step improved
and upgraded into the best possible version so far.
From here on, the future researchers could use the system not only to train bad bots
in this case, but to achieve many different types of tasks, which is the wonders of the
CMA algorithm that as long as you could relate an experiment to a score, it can be used
to optimize a system.
