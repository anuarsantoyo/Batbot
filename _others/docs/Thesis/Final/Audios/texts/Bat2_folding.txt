Using this version of the BATBOT, several experiments were made.
First of all, we wanted to see the influence the folding and unfolding mechanism had on the lift.
For this, we did an experiment that we named the grid experiment.
The idea of the grid experiment was that we would try 10 different attack angle positions
of the BATBOT as well as 10 different flapping frequencies.
That would total it 100 experiments.
So we would do 100 experiments without using the folding and extending mechanism
and one using the folding and extending mechanism.
The result of this experiment, as seen in Figure 4,
can clearly show that when folding and unfolding, a higher resulting lift was achieved.
Almost in every single experiment seen compared to the experiment where only extended wings were used.
The only case in which this seems to be the other way around is when the attack angle has higher values,
which is indeed very logical as the higher the attack angle is.
In this case, the downstroke and the upstroke both play in favor of generating higher lift,
which is defined as a force in the vertical positive direction.
If we use the attack angle 45 at a flapping frequency of 6,
we can also clearly see in Figure 7 where the green area represents upstroke
and the white area represents downstroke that the peak lift achieved is more or less the same in both situations.
But during downstroke, during upstroke, the force generated downwards is definitely much lower,
which results in a higher resulting lift.
