As mentioned before
We have already parametrized the movement of the high legs of the Batbot to be an ellipse
Now I would like to explain
how the
Wing cycle measurement will be used in order to
Synchronously control the hind leg movements. I
Will start by defining not only the hind leg movements, but also
The command to fold or extend the wings
This is quite straightforward
If we find ourselves in the upstroke movement
Then the wings should be folded in order to reduce air resistance
If we detect a downward movement
Then the wings should be extended
Next I will explain
the movement of the
Leg in the vertical direction with respect to the wing cycle as a reminder the wing
Cycle (cyc_pi) goes from 0 to 2p being 0 the
lowest point and
Starting all the way to the upward
Which would mean that it goes from 0 to pi in the terms of the wing cycle and then
from pi to 2pi
During the down stroke
With this measurement
The angle
Of the vertical movement of the hind leg will be calculated as follow
First
Using this formula the y-angle is equal to the
Neutral state of the y-angle
Minus
The y-amplitude
Multiplied by the cosine of
The
cyc_pi
What we do with this formula is first state the neutral state of the
Leg which means the neutral angle and then by multiplying the
amplitude
with the cosine of
The cyc_pi
What we do is oscillate
between
Minus one and one which is multiplied by the amplitude
So the amplitude depending on the cycle in which we are finding ourselves of the wind bit
Would be either
Multiplied times one or times minus one
Which will make the leg go
Up and down
Synchronously to the movement of the
Wing
Now with respect of the lateral movement
The lateral movement is accomplished in a very similar way though. It has a very important
Difference
Similar to the y-movement the x-angle is calculated as being equal to
the x-neutral angle
Plus
the x-amplitude
times
The sinus of (and here comes a different part)
my cyc_pi
plus
two times pi
multiplied by
the
parameter
ellipse angle
this last term
Two times pi times ellipse angle
Creates a delay within the sine function
Let's remember that the ellipse angle has values that range between zero and one
So when multiplied by two pi
We get values that go from zero to two pi
Which is actually all that we're achieving is a shift a phase shift of
the x
movement with respect to the
Y movement
If there were no shift involved we would only see a circle
but as we added this
term within
the sine function we create a shift and
as the
Amplitudes and middle points have been already determined what this shift enables us to do is to change the form of
The ellipse
It can make it
thinner
wider or it could even
change the direction of the rotation
To clockwise or counterclockwise
This way we can calculate the exact position the leg should have
Using as a reference
The point on the wing beat cycle that the wings find themselves in.

I would like you to please explain all of what I've just said in a master thesis
format and also give the result back in a latex code with correct mathematical
representations.
