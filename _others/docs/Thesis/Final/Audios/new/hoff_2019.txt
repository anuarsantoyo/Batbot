In the paper trajectory planning for a bat-like flapping wing robot, the scientist Jhonathan
Hoff, \cite{hoff_2019}, developed a bat dot that is able to follow a design
trajectory with its onboard electronics.
They also used a load sensor to obtain force data for parameter selection and computationally
inexpensive analysis, which can be used efficiently in a nonlinear solver.
