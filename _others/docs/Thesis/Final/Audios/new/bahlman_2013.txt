In the paper Designing Characterization of a Multiarticulated Robotic Bat Wing, written
by Joseph Vollmann, site Vollmann underscore 2013, the scientists developed a replica of
a robotic wing of a bat, specifically the fruit bat, which they use in order to analyze
dynamics in kinematics as well as inputs given to the wing compared to the output that was
measured on a test bench.
They used a very smart design that controlled the joints and the limbs of the bat using
strings which made the wing to be light, flexible and controllable.
