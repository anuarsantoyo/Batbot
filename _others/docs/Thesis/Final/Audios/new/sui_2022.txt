In the paper, Optimum design of a novel bio-inspired bat robot by Tingting Sui, site Sui underscore
2022.
The scientists used PCAN optimization algorithms in order to design a new structure of the
wing of a bat by trying to approach the movement of the limbs of the real bat and the data
that they had from the movement of the real bat to simulate as close as possible the movement
of a simulated version of the robot bat's wing.
