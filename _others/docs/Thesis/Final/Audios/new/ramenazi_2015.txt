In the paper Lagrangian Modeling and Flight Control of an Articulated Winged Bat
bought, written by Alireza Raminasi, site Raminasi underscore 2015.
A bat robot called B2 was developed, simulated the articulated skeleton of the bats, with
the idea of understanding the connection between the bat's flight dynamic and the physiological
and morphological specializations.
A particularity of these thesis, or better said article, is that they also introduced
a holonomical constrained Lagrangian model of the flapping robot, as well as a calculus
of variation of the method of inverse dynamics, which were implied to synthesize the flight
control algorithm of the flapping wings.
