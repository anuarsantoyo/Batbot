In this test we used the V2 of the Batbot. The legs were static and parallel to the body, the wings also were always
extended.
For the moment only the motor speed and attack angle were optimized.
motor = np.interp(motor, [0, 1], [260, 270])
attack_angle = np.interp(attack_angle, [0, 1], [80, 130])

This test used the old DAQ and show BEAUTIFUL results, the results were so good that I had to double check. Even though
we only used 1 iteration we can see that the score function very clearly reveals itself and shows to be quite smooth
(as expected).
