In this test I tried to used for the first time half-successfully the optimization of the attack angle. For some reason
sometimes the ESP8266 resets, I believe it is related to the current draw by high motor power, never the less in this
it did not happen, but instead sometimes the angle servo stopped strongly pulling and the Batbot falled during the
experiment.
