In this test we used the V2 of the Batbot. The legs were static and parallel to the body, the wings also were folding
and unfolding.
For the moment only the motor speed and attack angle were optimized.
motor = np.interp(motor, [0, 1], [260, 270])
attack_angle = np.interp(attack_angle, [0, 1], [80, 130])

Because of the acoustic noise generated, I decided to stop at only one generation. The results were so smooth and from
the experience of the last results I can confidently use this results for analysis without the need of repeating the
experiment several times (at least for now).
In experiments/optimizer_batbotV2_2D/data/230830/grid_test2/results_compared.html we can see the score comparison of one
experiment using folding and other extending, it can be seen that when using folding in almost each grid point the score
is clearly smaller.
