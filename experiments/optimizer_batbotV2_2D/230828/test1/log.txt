In this test we used the V2 of the Batbot. The legs were static and parallel to the body, the wings also were always
extended, this was because at first I had problems to install the magnetic encoder, but after seeing such good results
I think it is also good to show the improvement when gradually adding optimizations (folding, leg-flapping).
For the moment only the motor speed and attack angle were optimized.
motor = np.interp(motor, [0, 1], [260, 270])
attack_angle = np.interp(attack_angle, [0, 1], [80, 130])

This is the repetition of the tests done on 230825 to see what happened with the sudden jump of the error.
Some issues with the wings were solved and also all the wires were finally organized. This can be considered the first
real experiment compared to the other tests used to find error or test stuff.

The wing broke at generation 14 and was repaired. The results show that using Richard DAQ is to noisy, and the score
variance in solutions that are close to each other is too high.
