In this test we used the V2 of the Batbot. The legs were static and parallel to the body, the wings also were always
extended, this was because at first I had problems to install the magnetic encoder, but after seeing such good results
I think it is also good to show the improvement when gradually adding optimizations (folding, leg-flapping).
For the moment only the motor speed and attack angle were optimized.
motor = np.interp(motor, [0, 1], [260, 270])
attack_angle = np.interp(attack_angle, [0, 1], [80, 130])

The results show that the score could be improved by increasing the motor and the optimal angle was found at
with motor of 0.978048 and attack of 0.3806964.

For some strange reason, the scores jumped to very high levels (compared to initial scores) even though experiments
runned using the same optimal parameters were done.
