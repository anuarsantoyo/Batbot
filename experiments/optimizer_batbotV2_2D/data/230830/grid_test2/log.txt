In this test we used the V2 of the Batbot. The legs were static and parallel to the body, the wings also were folding
and unfolding.
For the moment only the motor speed and attack angle were optimized.
motor = np.interp(motor, [0, 1], [260, 270])
attack_angle = np.interp(attack_angle, [0, 1], [80, 130])

Because of the noise generated, I decided to stop at only one generation. The results were so smooth and from the
experience of the last results I can confidently use this results for analysis without the need of repeating the
experiment several times (at least for now). In results_compared we can see
