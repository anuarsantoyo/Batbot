In this test we used the V2 of the Batbot. The legs were static and parallel to the body, the wings also were always
extended.
For the moment only the motor speed and attack angle were optimized.
motor = np.interp(motor, [0, 1], [260, 270])
attack_angle = np.interp(attack_angle, [0, 1], [80, 130])

I did 3 generations of grid test and also added in results_combined.html the results of 230829. So in total we had 4
grid search generations. The scores showed to be stable, as all the scores for a solutions had a small variance, the
score function was clearly and smoothly seen in each generation.
