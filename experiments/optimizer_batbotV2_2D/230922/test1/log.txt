The idea on this experiment is to do the whole process of optimization.
We will train first only the 2D to find the correct flapping and angle and then used that info to keep optimizing using
the other 5D.
Important changes on this experiment.
Fitness_mean() will be used in the whole process to ensure a valid comparison a battery has been added to take its
weight into account and once the angle is found it will be physically fixed.
