So I changed a gear that was faulty and kept the motor and ellipse constant at one. Now I am only training for the
optimal legx,y and x,y amplitudes.
These are my used parameters:

motor = np.interp(1, [0, 1], [260, 270])
leg_x = np.interp(leg_x, [0, 1], [40, 120])
leg_y = np.interp(leg_y, [0, 1], [30, 150])
leg_x_amplitude = np.interp(leg_x_amplitude, [0, 1], [0, 40])
leg_y_amplitude = np.interp(leg_y_amplitude, [0, 1], [0, 60])
ellipse_angle = 1

I also disabled the min max angle correction in the Batbot as I am always using the same motor speed
The results seem to not converge, I see 3 possible problems:

- The folding seems to be a bit off, need deeper look into (Done! tightened some screws on the wings, that seems to
have made it)
- The membrane in the legs seems loose (the gear also sounds funny)
- The sensor has low data frequency (done!)

Might consider doing "Wartung" after each test
