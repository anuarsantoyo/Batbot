this parameters where used:
motor = np.interp(motor, [0, 1], [260, 280])
leg_x = np.interp(leg_x, [0, 1], [40, 120])
leg_y = np.interp(leg_y, [0, 1], [30, 150])
leg_x_amplitude = np.interp(leg_x_amplitude, [0, 1], [0, 40])
leg_y_amplitude = np.interp(leg_y_amplitude, [0, 1], [0, 60])

I am going to do the next experiment using motor from 260-270 because if the Batbot breaks I am in big problem.
But the results looked good. Again the best scores are achieved with high motor and high ellipse, an idea could be to
in the future fix motor and ellipse to 1.
